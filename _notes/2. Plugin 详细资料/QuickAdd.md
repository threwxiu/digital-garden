## Getting started

The first thing you'll want to do is add a new choice. A choice can be one of four types.

-   [Template Choice](app://obsidian.md/docs/Choices/TemplateChoice.md)Â - A powerful way to insert templates into your vault.
-   [Capture Choice](app://obsidian.md/docs/Choices/CaptureChoice.md)Â - Quick capture anything, anywhere.
-   [Macro Choice](app://obsidian.md/docs/Choices/MacroChoice.md)Â - Macros to augment your workflow. Do more, faster.
-   [Multi Choice](app://obsidian.md/docs/Choices/MultiChoice.md)Â - Organize your choices in folders.

In your choices, you can useÂ [format syntax](app://obsidian.md/docs/FormatSyntax.md), which is similar to the Obsidian template syntax.

You could, for example, useÂ `{{DATE}}`Â to get the current date.
