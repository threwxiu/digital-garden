# Obsidian Mind Map

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/lynchjames/obsidian-mind-map/Release%20Build?logo=github&style=for-the-badge) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/lynchjames/obsidian-mind-map?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)

This repository contains a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for viewing Markdown notes as Mind Maps using [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/).

A similar plugin is available for [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gera2ld.markmap-vscode).

## Features

-   Preview your current note as a Mind Map
-   Mind Map preview updates as you select other panes, similar to the [Local Graph](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-open-a-local-graph-view-pane-on-the-right-sidebar/7190), [Outline](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Plugins/Outline) and [Backlink](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Plugins/Backlinks) panes

#### Copy screenshot

Places a copy of the Mind Map SVG on your clipboard allowing you to paste it into a note in Obsidian or into an image editor of your choice.
