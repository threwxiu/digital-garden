# Obsidian Annotator

This is a plugin for Obsidian ([https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)). It allows you to open and annotate PDF and EPUB files.

The plugin is based on [https://web.hypothes.is/](https://web.hypothes.is/), but modified to store the annotations in a local markdown file instead of on the internet.

## Demonstration

![annotator demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9102856/131702952-1aa76baa-a279-474c-978d-cec95a683485.gif)

**Warning!** In the above gif I use **Dataview** syntax to specify the annotation-target.  
If you do not have the dataview plugin installed, you must instead write the annotation-target in the **frontmatter**, like this:

```md
---
annotation-target: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13478.pdf
---
```

## Getting Started

Add the property `annotation-target` to the frontmatter of your obsidian note, with a value corresponding to the location of the EPUB/PDF file.  
The location can either be a file in the vault (such as `Pdfs/mypdf.pdf`), or online (such as `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13478.pdf`)

Then you can, in the open note pane, select "more options" (the three dots in the top right), and a new option "annotate" should be available.

The plugin automatically tries to determine whether the file is an `epub` or `pdf` based on the file path, but in case this doesn't work,  
you can also add the property `annotation-target-type` and specify whether it is `epub` or `pdf` manually.

If you have [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) installed, then you can also specify the annotation target with a dataview attribute. In this case, obsidian-style links can be used instead of a plain-text path.

> WARNING! Don't rename an original pdf or epub file! The plugin is going to lose the connection between annotations and file in that case.

### Annotating

Annotation is self-explanatory. Select text with your mouse to get started.

In the future, it would be nice to add colored highlights and image/region highlights. These features will have to be added to hypothes.is first, however.  
See these relevant issues: [https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/198](https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/198), [https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/669](https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/669)

### The annotations in markdown

To return to the regular obsidian markdown editing mode, you can select `more options` → `Open as MD`.  
Each annotation has an associated quote block with a block reference. Be careful with modifying these blocks.  
Minor edits to PREFIX, HIGHLIGHT, and POSTFIX are typically ok. But if the edits are too major, hypothesis may no longer be able to identify the corresponding text.

The COMMENT region can be freely edited. (but ensure that it is still part of the quote block.)

The TAGS region should consist of a comma-separated list of obsidian tags. (like `#tag1, #tag2, #tag3`)

### Dark Mode

The plugin has built-in dark mode support. To toggle dark mode, select `more options` → `Toggle Dark Mode` while annotating.  
You can also tweak the dark mode behavior in the settings tab for the plugin.

### Linking to annotations

An obsidian link to an annotation block-reference will, when clicked, open the corresponding file and scroll to the associated highlight.  
If the file is already open in a pane, then the link will cause the existing pane to scroll instead.

## Changelog

### 0.2.4 (2022-07-23)

-   Fix [plugin fails to start on iPad](https://github.com/elias-sundqvist/obsidian-annotator/issues/176)

### 0.2.2 (2022-05-14) _Minor improvement_

-   hypothes.is updated up to v1.1055.0

### 0.2.1 (2022-03-06) **[BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) release** _Basic web and video annotation_

-   `annotation-target-type` can now take on the values `web` and `video`.
    -   With `web` the annotation target can (in theory) be any website. Some work better than others. Link navigation does not work.
    -   With `video`, only youtube links are supported. In order to use this feature, a link to a zip file with the annotator.tv resources must be provided in the plugin settings. It cannot be bundled with the plugin since that would most likely violate copyright.
        -   You can ask someone for a link, or generate it yourself by making an account at annotate.tv, signing in, going to [https://annotate.tv/videos/620d5a42b9ab630009bf3e31#](https://annotate.tv/videos/620d5a42b9ab630009bf3e31#), and downloading the website using the [Save All Resources](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-all-resources/abpdnfjocnmdomablahdcfnoggeeiedb?hl=en) chrome extension, uploading it to google drive, and [generating a direct link](https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/).
    -   Other improvements:
        -   Some behind-the-scenes changes have been made so that the hypothes.is version can be more easily upgraded in the future.

    -   A basic unit-test for annotation loading has also been added. More tests will be added as issues arise. This will guarantee that the plugin becomes increasingly stable over time.

-   By holding the shift key you can now drag highlights from the epub/pdf into a separate Obsidian note, and a link to the highlight will be inserted.
